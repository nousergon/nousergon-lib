"""The underscored-extras guard, and proof it fails when the fix is reverted.

`overseer-policy.md` #13: a guard is not a guard until it has been observed
failing. The reverted-tree cases below are that observation — they reconstruct
the exact spelling that took the weekly pipeline down (alpha-engine-config-I6963)
and assert the checker rejects it.

Root cause being guarded: pip <23.3 does not normalise `_` to `-` in a
*requested* extra, while setuptools always normalises the *declared* one. So
`krepis[flow_doctor]` matches nothing against `Provides-Extra: flow-doctor`, and
pip reports that as a WARNING on a SUCCESSFUL exit. Measured 2026-08-12:
pip 23.2.1 resolves 18 packages with flow-doctor absent; 23.3.2 / 24.0 / 25.0
resolve 30 with it present. Amazon Linux 2023 ships pip 23.2.1.

Most cases call ``main()`` in-process so the checker's own lines are measured by
coverage; one case shells out, because the CLI exit-code contract is what CI
actually depends on and an in-process call would not exercise it.
