"""Egress regression guard — CI-enforced mechanical check (config#2958 deliverable 3).

The 2026-07-16 Neon quota exhaustion's proximate cause was a single SQL
fragment (``SELECT c.embedding FROM rag.chunks``) running a full-corpus
vector read amplified by per-PR canary replays. The fix for that specific
site is centroid pushdown (``AVG(c.embedding)``, server-side) — but prose
docstring conventions don't prevent the same class of unbounded embedding
read from being re-introduced in a new module or a refactor.

This test closes the enforcement gap: it mechanically scans every Python file
under ``src/nousergon_lib/rag/`` for SQL fragments (lines containing both a
SQL keyword and ``.embedding``) and fails if any embedding-column reference
lacks a safe wrapper — aggregators (AVG, VAR_SAMP, COUNT, ...), the pgvector
``<=>`` cosine-distance operator, or ``IS [NOT] NULL`` in a WHERE clause.

A line that ships a raw 512-dim vector across the wire to a single caller
(even one consumer) could, if replayed across every canary push the way the
``synchronize`` trigger amplified the old query, re-exhaust the quota. This
test makes that pattern structurally impossible to reintroduce without
failing CI.

The whitelist is deliberately narrow — false positives (a line that looks
dangerous but isn't) should be *suppressed by adding it to the list*, not
by widening the regex. The list is checked at runtime: a safe line that
was dropped from the source (refactored away) yields a CI failure so the
stale entry is removed immediately rather than silently rotting.

See nousergon-data's ``tests/test_rag_egress_regression_guard.py`` for the
identical guard on the ingestion/consumer side. The two guards cover the
SQL sites in the library (retrieval path) and the data pipelines (ingest
+ batch-read path) respectively.
