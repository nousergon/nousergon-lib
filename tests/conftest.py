"""Shared test fixtures for ``alpha_engine_lib``.

``publish`` (``alerts.py``) gained a ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` guard that
short-circuits real SNS / Telegram fan-out from inside any test process
(the cross-repo chokepoint, L4566). This lib's OWN alert tests, however,
deliberately exercise the real fan-out logic against mocked boto3 /
Telegram transports — so they must opt back in via the
``ALPHA_ENGINE_ALLOW_TEST_ALERTS`` escape hatch. Enable it for the whole
lib suite here; the one test that verifies the guard itself unsets it.
