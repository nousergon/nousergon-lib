"""Shared yfinance log-noise suppression + per-run coverage aggregation.

yfinance logs its own ERROR record per failing symbol — five-plus distinctly
worded messages for ONE unpriceable ticker (``quoteSummary`` 404, "possibly
delisted" in two forms, "1 Failed download:", per-period repeats). Flow Doctor
keys its dedup on message text, so each line becomes its own report/email:

  * the 2026-06-12 PCKM storm via ``collectors/metron_market_data.py``
    (alpha-engine-config#1029), and
  * the 2026-06-19 PCAR recurrence via the un-wrapped 10y price-cache refresh
    in ``collectors/prices.py`` (nousergon-data#455) — three Flow Doctor issues
    for ONE active, non-delisted ticker (the LLM diagnosis even hallucinated a
    delisting).

The chokepoint: demote yfinance's internal logger to CRITICAL for the duration
of each fetch (:func:`quiet_yfinance` / :func:`yf_quiet`), and replace the
suppressed per-symbol spray with ONE aggregated coverage record per artifact
per run (:func:`log_yf_coverage`) — the named recording surface, so a real
provider outage still surfaces once, loudly, instead of once per symbol.

This is the cross-repo chokepoint: the canonical primitive lifted out of
``nousergon-data``'s in-repo ``collectors/yfinance_quiet.py`` (itself extracted
from ``metron_market_data.py`` the moment the same bug class recurred through a
second collector). Per
``feedback_lift_invariants_to_chokepoint_after_second_recurrence``, the second
adopter is the signal to lift the invariant from an in-repo single source of
truth to ``nousergon_lib`` so every collector/repo that touches yfinance routes
through one source. Pure stdlib — no yfinance import — so the suppressor adds no
dependency to consumers that merely want quiet logs.

Toward nousergon/alpha-engine-config#1161.
