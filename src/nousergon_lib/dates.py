"""
dates.py — canonical "current date" attribution + freshness checks for
trade-related artifacts.

Implements the dual-tracking convention from
``alpha-engine-docs/private/DATE_CONVENTIONS.md``: every trade-related
artifact records both a ``calendar_date`` (wall-clock UTC) and a
``trading_day`` (last completed NYSE session). The ``trading_day``
attribution is strictly backward-looking — never ahead of "now" — so
artifacts produced on weekends, holidays, or pre-open weekday mornings
attribute to the most recent session that has actually closed.

Use this at every artifact-write site::

    from nousergon_lib.dates import now_dual

    dd = now_dual()
    record = {
        "calendar_date": dd.calendar_date,
        "trading_day": dd.trading_day,
        ...
    }

For backfilling historical rows that only have a wall-clock timestamp::

    from nousergon_lib.dates import session_for_timestamp

    trading_day = session_for_timestamp(row["created_at"])

To normalize an incoming calendar run_date to the trading day every producer
keys its artifacts by (e.g. at a Lambda/CLI entrypoint)::

    from nousergon_lib.dates import resolve_trading_day

    run_date = resolve_trading_day(event.get("date"))  # Sat → prior Fri

For freshness checks across the system, use the trading-day-aware helpers
rather than calendar-day arithmetic::

    from nousergon_lib.dates import is_fresh_in_trading_days

    # Producer-side postflight: did macro.SPY land the most recent close?
    if not is_fresh_in_trading_days(spy_last_date, run_date):
        raise PostflightError(...)

    # Consumer-side preflight: was the data refreshed within ≤1 trading day?
    if not is_fresh_in_trading_days(ticker_last_date, today, max_stale=1):
        raise PreflightError(...)

The freshness helpers replace the calendar-day-arithmetic patterns that bit
the 2026-05-24 SF recovery — every post-Saturday redrive trips a calendar-
day gate even when the data carries the most recent NYSE close. Calendar
days only happen to work on Saturday because Fri→Sat is +1 in both calendar
and trading-day arithmetic. See [[feedback_lift_invariants_to_chokepoint
_after_second_recurrence]] + [[feedback_sota_institutional_default_no_shortcuts]].

This module is a thin wrapper over
``nousergon_lib.trading_calendar.{last_closed_trading_day,count_trading_days}``
— its purpose is to standardize the *output shape* (DualDate) and provide a
single canonical entry point so every consumer sees the same semantics.

    Every artifact-write site should call this to populate the

    reaching for ``date.today()`` or ``datetime.now().date()``. Calling
    here ensures consistent semantics across modules and prevents the

    Canonical artifact-keying helper. DATE_CONVENTIONS: every trade artifact
    keys by the TRADING DAY, not the calendar date. The Saturday SF threads a
    CALENDAR run_date (``date(Execution.StartTime)`` — e.g. Sat 2026-05-30)
    while Research + signals.json + the backtester key by the trading day
    (Fri 2026-05-29). Normalizing the calendar run_date here keeps every
    consumer reading the same ``{module}/{trading_day}`` keys that the
    producers wrote (the research↔backtester pit-parity drift and the
    evaluator's 0/18-graded report card both traced to a consumer that
    trusted the calendar run_date verbatim).

    This is the single source of truth for the normalizer that was previously
    duplicated as ``pipeline_common.resolve_trading_day`` (backtester) and
    ``grading.handler._to_trading_day`` (evaluator) — both thin wrappers over
    ``trading_calendar``. Lifted to the lib chokepoint per
    [[feedback_lift_invariants_to_chokepoint_after_second_recurrence]].

    Behavior:
        * Idempotent — a trading-day input returns unchanged, so re-normalizing
          an already-normalized value (e.g. ``now_dual().trading_day`` or a
          bash-normalized ``RUN_DATE``) is a no-op.
        * Default (``date_str is None``) = today UTC, then normalized.
        * Tolerant of an ISO datetime/longer string — only the leading
          ``yyyy-mm-dd`` is parsed.
        * Defensive: on any parse failure, returns the input unchanged with a
          WARNING rather than raising. A date-normalization miss must not abort
          the caller (the backtester run or the non-fatal grading path).

    Args:
        date_str: ISO ``yyyy-mm-dd`` (or longer ISO) string, or ``None`` for

        before the input (the input itself if it is already a trading day),
