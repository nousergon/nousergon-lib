"""
dates.py — canonical "current date" attribution + freshness checks for
trade-related artifacts.

Implements the dual-tracking convention from
``alpha-engine-docs/private/DATE_CONVENTIONS.md``: every trade-related
artifact records both a ``calendar_date`` (wall-clock UTC) and a
``trading_day`` (last completed NYSE session). The ``trading_day``
attribution is strictly backward-looking — never ahead of "now" — so
artifacts produced on weekends, holidays, or pre-open weekday mornings
attribute to the most recent session that has actually closed.

Use this at every artifact-write site::

    from nousergon_lib.dates import now_dual

    dd = now_dual()
    record = {
        "calendar_date": dd.calendar_date,
        "trading_day": dd.trading_day,
        ...
    }

For backfilling historical rows that only have a wall-clock timestamp::

    from nousergon_lib.dates import session_for_timestamp

    trading_day = session_for_timestamp(row["created_at"])

For freshness checks across the system, use the trading-day-aware helpers
rather than calendar-day arithmetic::

    from nousergon_lib.dates import is_fresh_in_trading_days

    # Producer-side postflight: did macro.SPY land the most recent close?
    if not is_fresh_in_trading_days(spy_last_date, run_date):
        raise PostflightError(...)

    # Consumer-side preflight: was the data refreshed within ≤1 trading day?
    if not is_fresh_in_trading_days(ticker_last_date, today, max_stale=1):
        raise PreflightError(...)

The freshness helpers replace the calendar-day-arithmetic patterns that bit
the 2026-05-24 SF recovery — every post-Saturday redrive trips a calendar-
day gate even when the data carries the most recent NYSE close. Calendar
days only happen to work on Saturday because Fri→Sat is +1 in both calendar
and trading-day arithmetic. See [[feedback_lift_invariants_to_chokepoint
_after_second_recurrence]] + [[feedback_sota_institutional_default_no_shortcuts]].

This module is a thin wrapper over
``nousergon_lib.trading_calendar.{last_closed_trading_day,count_trading_days}``
— its purpose is to standardize the *output shape* (DualDate) and provide a
single canonical entry point so every consumer sees the same semantics.

    Attributes:

            Audit trail. Same on holidays/weekends as any other day; reflects
            *when* the process ran, not which session the data is about.
