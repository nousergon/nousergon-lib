"""
Shared structured logging + Flow Doctor integration.

Replaces near-identical copies of ``log_config.py`` in alpha-engine-data
and alpha-engine/executor. Consumers call :func:`setup_logging` once at
process startup; subsequent call sites retrieve the Flow Doctor instance
via :func:`get_flow_doctor`.

Modes:

- Text (default): human-readable single-line log format.
- JSON: activated by ``ALPHA_ENGINE_JSON_LOGS=1``. Emits one JSON object
  per log record, including tracebacks for errors.

Flow Doctor is **default-on** (since 0.58.0): it activates whenever a
``flow_doctor_yaml`` path is provided to :func:`setup_logging` — passing a
yaml IS the opt-in. ``FLOW_DOCTOR_DISABLED=1`` (or ``FLOW_DOCTOR_ENABLED=0``)
is the kill switch; a test context (``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST``) auto-disables
unless ``FLOW_DOCTOR_ALLOW_IN_TESTS=1``. This inverts the prior opt-in-per-
runtime default, whose failure mode was silently-dark runtimes. ERROR-level
records (including ``logger.exception``) fire the FlowDoctorHandler, which
dispatches per the yaml config (email + GitHub issue with dedup + rate
limits); wrap entrypoints in :func:`guard_entrypoint` / :func:`monitor_handler`
to also capture uncaught crashes.

In a deployed runtime (Lambda, or ``ALPHA_ENGINE_DEPLOYED=1`` on EC2/SF/spot)
a missing install / yaml / secret fails loud; in local dev / CI the same
conditions log a WARNING and skip activation. Requires the ``flow_doctor``
optional extra (``nousergon-lib[flow_doctor]``).
