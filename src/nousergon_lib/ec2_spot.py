"""
EC2 spot-launch capacity-resilience chokepoint.

Consolidation substrate for the spot-launch pattern that previously
appeared as three mirrored copies of the same fragility across the
alpha-engine fleet — each repo's launcher script (``spot_data_weekly.sh``
in alpha-engine-data, ``spot_train.sh`` in alpha-engine-predictor,
``spot_backtest.sh`` in alpha-engine-backtester) independently encoded
the same hardcoded ``--subnet-id`` (single AZ, us-east-1f) +
``--instance-type c5.large`` (single SKU) + N retries-with-backoff. When
AWS ran out of c5.large capacity in us-east-1f, every spot-launching
state failed simultaneously with no resilience.

**Why now (2026-05-22 evening):** The post-trap-fix dry-pass of the
Saturday SF (``postfix-keystone-20260522T232655Z``) hit
``InsufficientInstanceCapacity`` on the Evaluator's spot launch in
us-east-1f. The 2 earlier spots (Backtester + Parity) happened to clear
because AWS capacity rolled between the launches; Evaluator drew the
short straw. The defect class is "any single Saturday SF run has a
non-trivial chance of hitting capacity in at least one of the 3+ spot
states." The Friday-PM dry-pass exposed it (third in a row caught break
of the dry-pass safety net — first was the trap escape, second was the
keystone merge order, third is this).

**Why a CLI, not a bash function:**

Per ``~/Development/CLAUDE.md`` SOTA sub-sub-rule — "when mirroring a
pattern across repos, consider lifting it into ``nousergon-lib``...
Pure-Bash primitives can stay mirrored unless re-expressible as a Python
CLI entry callable from Bash, in which case the CLI re-expression is
the institutional path." Third repo with the same fragility is well
past the second-recurrence trigger. The CLI shape mirrors
:mod:`nousergon_lib.alerts` + :mod:`nousergon_lib.ssm_log_capture`
precedent.

**Strategy:**

The function iterates ``(instance_type, subnet)`` combinations in the
order given, attempting :func:`RunInstances` against each. On
``InsufficientInstanceCapacity`` / ``InsufficientHostCapacity`` /
``Unsupported`` (instance type not in AZ) → rotate to the next
combination. On any other error (auth, quota, AMI not found) → raise.

Caller controls the rotation order by listing types/subnets. Default
shape we use in the fleet:

- types: ``[c5.large, m5.large, c6i.large, c5a.large]`` (all 2 vCPU /
  ~4-8 GB RAM; capacity-resilient set chosen 2026-05-22)
- subnets: all default-VPC subnets across us-east-1{a,b,c,d,e,f}

**Public API:**

- :func:`launch` — Python API returning ``InstanceId`` on success,
  raising :class:`SpotCapacityExhausted` if every combination hit a
  capacity error, or :class:`SpotLaunchError` on any other error.
- CLI: ``python -m nousergon_lib.ec2_spot launch --types ... --subnets ...``.
  Returns ``InstanceId`` on stdout. Exits non-zero on failure;
  capacity-exhaustion exits 64 (distinguishable from generic failure).
- :func:`classify_termination` — classify why a (spot) instance terminated:
  ``reclaim`` (AWS reclaimed → caller should relaunch on a fresh spot),
  ``other`` (real crash / OOM / timeout → do NOT blind-retry), or ``unknown``.
  CLI: ``python -m nousergon_lib.ec2_spot classify-termination
  --instance-id <id>`` prints ``classification<TAB>state<TAB>reason_code<TAB>
  transition_reason``. The fleet-wide chokepoint for the spot-reclaim
  classification that previously lived (buggy) in ``spot_backtest.sh`` and was
  absent from ``spot_train.sh`` / the data spot launchers.
- :func:`relaunch_decision` / ``relaunch-decision`` CLI — the bounded mid-run
  relaunch DECISION wrapped around classification: given the attempt number, a
  ``MAX_SPOT_ATTEMPTS`` budget, and (optionally) the outer SF
  ``executionTimeout`` coupling guard, decide whether the launcher should exec a
  fresh spot. Lifts the divergent inline copies in ``spot_data_weekly.sh`` (#349)
  and ``spot_backtest.sh`` (#283/#289) and supplies the missing predictor
  adopter. CLI exits 0 = relaunch, 75 = hold (fail loud).
