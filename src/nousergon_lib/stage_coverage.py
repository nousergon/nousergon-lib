"""Per-stage output assertion — the ONE implementation, called from every stage.

**What this asserts.** A Step Functions run establishes that a stage did not
THROW. Nothing in it establishes that the stage WROTE. Those are different
claims and only the second is what the trading week depends on: on 2026-08-08
five weekly stages produced no output while the run terminated ``SUCCEEDED``,
and every one of them exited zero (``alpha-engine-config-I7167``).

**Where the assertion belongs — and why it is here rather than at the end of
the run.** `sf-pipeline-policy.md` §2.1 (atomicity: one stage, one script, one
failure route) puts the assertion at the boundary where the fact becomes
knowable — the moment the stage's own launcher or handler is about to exit.
Two prior designs placed it at the pipeline's convergence point instead, as a
single end-of-run sweep. Both were ruled non-SOTA on the same two axes
(Brian, 2026-08-13):

1. **Detection latency.** The weekly pipeline runs ~4h. A sweep at the
   convergence point learns that ``MorningEnrich`` wrote nothing roughly three
   hours after the fact — after every downstream stage has already consumed
   the absence.
2. **Attribution.** A sweep cannot attribute a miss to a stage that is still
   in flight, and it must reconstruct the entered-stage set from execution
   history to avoid crying wolf on gated-out runs. The stage itself needs
   neither: it knows it ran, and it knows what it declared.

The corollary that makes this shippable: asserting inside the launcher costs
**no topology change** — no new SF state, no new Lambda, no new IAM role, no
operator-gated bootstrap. Launcher scripts already run under an instance
profile holding ``s3:GetObject``/``s3:ListBucket`` on the research bucket, and
every Lambda-backed stage already writes to it.

**One implementation, two front doors.** Per `policy-shared-code`, this is at
least the third adoption of the same logic, which is the lift trigger:

- **Bash launchers** (``spot_*.sh`` in nousergon-data, crucible-backtester,
  crucible-predictor) call the CLI::

      "$LIB_PYTHON" -m nousergon_lib.stage_coverage assert --stage MorningEnrich

- **Lambda handlers** call :func:`assert_stage_coverage` directly, immediately
  before returning their payload, and merge the returned verdict into it.

Neither carries a copy of the rules, a copy of the stage list, or a copy of
the registry. A per-repo copy is the fork `policy-shared-code` forbids.

**The declaration is data, and it is NOT redefined here.** Stage → artifact
comes from ``ARTIFACT_REGISTRY.yaml``'s ``pipeline_stages:`` section, read
from the S3 mirror ``alpha-engine-config``'s ``sync-artifact-registry.yml``
refreshes on every merge that touches it — so the consumer is refreshed by the
same event that changes the declaration. Nothing here carries its own list of
stages: a hand-maintained denominator drifts, and its drift is invisible
because the missing rows produce no signal.

**Observe mode is the default and the assertion cannot fail the run.** Every
error path returns a verdict; no path raises to the caller. ``--enforce``
flips one boolean, and only a real ``MISSING`` (not ``STALE``, not
``UNMEASURED``) is allowed to signal failure — enforcing a threshold whose
distribution nobody has seen is how a correct detector gets switched off in
week one (Brian ruling 2026-08-11,
``ruling_detect_before_enforcing_when_the_floor_is_unmeasured``).

**Could-not-measure is never a pass, and never a finding either.** An
unreadable registry, a non-404 probe failure, an unresolvable cycle date, or a
stage absent from the registry are all :data:`STATUS_UNMEASURED` — never
:data:`STATUS_COVERED` (`sf-pipeline-policy.md` §2.3a rule 2: a missing verdict
propagates as UNKNOWN, never as pass) and never :data:`STATUS_MISSING` (a
detector that reports its own harness fault AS the defect is this fleet's
most-repeated detector bug, and it always errs in the alarming direction).

**A stage declaring ``output: none`` is COVERED by having said so.** That is
the entire point of the registry's stage section: it is what distinguishes a
stage that writes nothing from a stage nobody ever considered. Eleven of the
43 weekly stages are in this class; they assert nothing and still record that
they declared nothing.

**The cycle date is not the run date.** ``{date}`` / ``{trading_day}`` in a key
template resolve to the *cycle* tick — the last closed trading day — not to
the execution's ``run_date``. Measured 2026-08-13: the 08-08 execution carries
``run_date=2026-08-08`` while every artifact it produced landed under
``2026-08-07``; resolving with ``run_date`` produced 28 confident and entirely
false ``missing`` verdicts. :func:`resolve_cycle_date` defers to
:func:`krepis.trading_calendar.last_closed_trading_day`, the same notion
:func:`nousergon_lib.artifact_freshness._format_key` substitutes, and returns
``None`` rather than guessing when it cannot resolve.

**Public surface:**

- :data:`STATUS_COVERED` / :data:`STATUS_COVERED_NO_OUTPUT` /
  :data:`STATUS_MISSING` / :data:`STATUS_STALE` / :data:`STATUS_UNMEASURED`
- :class:`StageVerdict` — the record written to S3 and returned to callers.
- :func:`assert_stage_coverage` — the Lambda-handler front door; never raises.
- :func:`evaluate_stage` — the pure ``(registry, stage, …) → StageVerdict``
  core, injected clients only, no side effects.
- :func:`record_verdict` — the S3 + CloudWatch recording surface.
- :func:`main` — the ``python -m nousergon_lib.stage_coverage`` CLI.
