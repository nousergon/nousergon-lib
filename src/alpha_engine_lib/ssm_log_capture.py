SSM-step log capture + S3 ship-on-exit chokepoint.

Consolidation substrate for the trap-and-log-ship pattern that previously
appeared as an inline bash EXIT trap in every long Step Functions SSM
state across the alpha-engine fleet (MorningEnrich, DataPhase1,
RAGIngestion, DriftDetection in alpha-engine-data; PredictorTraining in
alpha-engine-predictor; Backtester, Parity, Evaluator in
alpha-engine-backtester). The pre-lift form looked like::

    trap 'aws s3 cp /var/log/X.log "s3://alpha-engine-research/_ssm_logs/X/$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)/$(hostname)-$(date -u +%H%M%SZ).log" --only-show-errors || true' EXIT
    bash infrastructure/<launcher>.sh ... 2>&1 | tee /var/log/X.log

The pattern was originally added by alpha-engine-data PR #244
(2026-05-15) to close the diagnostic gap where SSM's 24KB
``StandardOutputContent`` cap was hiding the root cause of long-step
failures: by the time SF Catch surfaced exit-1, the spot instance had
self-terminated and the full ``/var/log/X.log`` was gone with it. The
EXIT trap fires before the script's real exit propagates, ships the log
to S3, then yields back so the real exit code reaches the SF.

**Why the lift to lib (2026-05-22):** PR #253 in alpha-engine-data
(merged 2026-05-17) switched all 8 Saturday-SF spot states from plain
``commands`` JSON arrays to ``commands.$ States.Array(...)`` so they
could splice ``$.run_date`` / ``$.preflight_args`` via ``States.Format``.
Inside ``States.Array`` arg strings, ASL's documented escape for an
inner single quote is ``\\'`` — but in practice the AWS ASL evaluator
does NOT unescape ``\\'`` to ``'``, it passes the backslash through
literally. The trap line ``'trap \\'cmd\\' EXIT'`` rendered into the
SSM ``_script.sh`` as ``trap \\'cmd\\' EXIT``; bash interpreted the
``\\'`` outside quotes as a literal apostrophe stripped of its quoting
power, then word-split the line and passed every token after ``aws`` to
``trap`` as a signal name. Symptom: ``trap: s3: invalid signal
specification``, exit 127 at line 7 of ``_script.sh``. The 2026-05-22
Friday-PM shell-run dry-pass of the Saturday SF caught this exactly as
designed (it was the first execution under the broken pattern; no
Saturday SF had run between #253 merge and the dry-pass).

Per the ``~/Development/CLAUDE.md`` SOTA / institutional-approach rule —
sub-sub-rule "when mirroring a pattern across repos, consider lifting
it into ``alpha-engine-lib``... Pure-Bash primitives can stay mirrored
unless re-expressible as a Python CLI entry callable from Bash, in
which case the CLI re-expression is the institutional path" — this
module is the canonical Python primitive. The SF JSON now spells a
single ``States.Format``-rendered string (no bash trap, no bash
quoting, no ASL escape surface) and the consumer behavior lives here
where it can be tested independently of every state's JSON shape.

**Public API:**

- :func:`run` — execute an inner command, tee its merged stdout+stderr
  to a local log file AND to the parent process's stdout, on exit
  (any code, including subprocess crash) ship the log to S3, return
  the inner exit code verbatim.
- CLI: ``python -m alpha_engine_lib.ssm_log_capture run --slug <X>
  --log /var/log/<X>.log -- <inner-cmd...>``. Designed for SF JSON;
  a single ``States.Format`` template with ``$.preflight_args``
  interpolated via ``{}`` produces the entire invocation as one
  un-quoted token list — no bash trap, no inner single quotes.

**S3 layout:**

``s3://{bucket}/_ssm_logs/{slug}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{hostname}-{HHMMSSZ}.log``

Defaults: ``bucket=alpha-engine-research``, prefix ``_ssm_logs``. Date,
time, and hostname are computed at exit time (so a multi-hour run that
straddles UTC midnight gets the actual exit-side date in the key).

**Failure behavior — never raises:**

- Inner command's exit code is propagated verbatim. Subprocess setup
  failure (e.g., ``FileNotFoundError`` on the binary) is logged to the
  log file and stderr, returns 127 to match the bash convention.
- S3 upload failures (boto3 ``ClientError``, missing creds, missing
  log file) are logged at WARNING and swallowed. The SF Catch must
  see the true inner exit, not a secondary log-capture failure that
  would mask it. Matches :mod:`alpha_engine_lib.alerts`' fail-safe
  posture.
