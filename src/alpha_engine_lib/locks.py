"""
Producer-side write-coordination locks for Alpha Engine modules.

This module ships the single-writer-per-resource primitive that closes
the producer-side half of the same invariant the L4 SF MutualExclusionGuard
(DynamoDB conditional PUT, ROADMAP L274) enforces at the SF-execution
entry point.

**Why both layers.** The SF mutex catches duplicate cron-fired triggers
into the same Step Function (operator double-paste of
``aws stepfunctions start-execution``, EventBridge internal retry-on-
throttle, cross-region replay coincidence). It does NOT catch
operator-launched manual invocations that bypass the SF entirely —
e.g. ``python -m builders.daily_append`` from a forensic / backfill /
dev shell. Without a producer-side lock those manual runs could race
the SF-driven path at ArcticDB exactly like the 2026-05-26 dup-EB-
target incident did (321 unique-symbol ``E_NON_INCREASING_INDEX_VERSION``
races on the same trading instance). The producer-side lock is the
load-bearing surface for the manual-invocation path; the SF mutex is
the load-bearing surface for the SF-entry path. Both layers, the same
"single writer per resource" invariant.

**API.** :func:`universe_writer_lock` is a context manager:

.. code-block:: python

    from alpha_engine_lib.locks import (
        universe_writer_lock,
        LockHeldByAnotherWriterError,
    )

    try:
        with universe_writer_lock(writer_id="daily_append-prod"):
            daily_append(...)
    except LockHeldByAnotherWriterError as exc:
        # `exc.holder` carries the live lock's body so operators can
        # see who owns it without re-reading S3:
        #   {writer_id, started_at, ttl_epoch, hostname, pid}
        logger.error("daily_append refused: lock held by %s", exc.holder)
        raise SystemExit(1)

The first writer's ``put_object`` with ``IfNoneMatch="*"`` succeeds and
creates ``s3://{bucket}/{lock_key}``. Subsequent writers get
``ClientError`` with code ``PreconditionFailed`` (HTTP 412) and this
module translates that into :exc:`LockHeldByAnotherWriterError`. On
normal exit (success OR exception), the context manager
``delete_object``-s the lock — best-effort; never raises, never masks
the inner exception. The S3 lifecycle rule on the ``locks/`` prefix
is the hard backstop (TTL purge for processes that died uncleanly).

**Soft TTL self-recovery.** If a lock is present but its ``ttl_epoch``
has elapsed, :func:`universe_writer_lock` treats it as abandoned:
deletes it, then attempts a fresh conditional PUT. The soft TTL absorbs
the gap between a process dying uncleanly (kill -9, OOM-killer,
SIGTERM cleanup-skip) and the next S3 lifecycle sweep. The hard TTL
(S3 lifecycle ``expires_after_days=1`` on the ``locks/`` prefix) is the
authoritative purger — set it operator-side; this module does not
attempt to manage S3 lifecycle config.

**Why S3, not DynamoDB.** ROADMAP L274's SF mutex uses DynamoDB
conditional PUT — appropriate there because the SF state machine
already has DynamoDB grants for other coordination. The producer-side
lock attaches to a process that already has S3 GetObject/PutObject on
``alpha-engine-research/*`` (every ae-data caller does), so S3 keeps
the IAM surface narrow — no new resource grants required.

**Composes with.**

- :mod:`alpha_engine_lib.alerts` — when ``LockHeldByAnotherWriterError``
  fires from a daemon/cron-launched run, the caller's failure handler
  can publish to SNS+Telegram via :func:`alpha_engine_lib.alerts.publish`.
- ROADMAP L274 — the SF MutualExclusionGuard at the SF entry point.
  This module covers the producer-side path; L274 covers the SF path.
