"""Bounded-backoff HTTP retry primitive — the transient external-API
resilience chokepoint (L4499).

Consolidates the backoff + full-jitter + ``Retry-After`` + api-key-scrub
retry idiom that was mirrored across four alpha-engine-data sites:

  * ``collectors/daily_closes.py::_fred_get_with_retry``     (L4480)
  * ``polygon_client.py::_get`` / ``_backoff``               (L4496)
  * ``preflight.py::_reachability_get``                      (L4494)
  * ``collectors/daily_closes_fred_repair.py::_fetch_fred_range``

Each had its own copy of "exponential backoff + full jitter, honor
``Retry-After``, retry the transient class, scrub the api-key from the
error before logging/raising, then fail loud." This module is the single
source of truth for that policy so the four callsites stop drifting.

Two layers are exported:

  * :func:`request_with_retry` — the full GET-with-retry for the plain
    callsites (FRED fetch, preflight probe, FRED repair). Returns the final
    ``requests.Response``; the caller still owns status interpretation
    (``raise_for_status`` / special-casing a 403), so genuinely different
    consumers compose it without a leaky mega-config.
  * :func:`backoff_delay` + :func:`scrub_api_keys` — the low-level pieces for
    a consumer with bespoke control flow (the rate-limited ``polygon_client``
    keeps its own loop + 403 handling + JSON parse + rate limiter, but shares
    the delay math and the scrubber).

Design note (anti-over-engineering): this is deliberately NOT a
pluggable-everything HTTP framework. It captures the one invariant the four
sites share; consumers whose semantics diverge (polygon's 403 + rate limiter)
reuse the primitives rather than being forced through a generic loop.
